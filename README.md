<h1 align="center">Car Insurance Cost Simulations Using Julia.</h1>

<h3 align="center">This repository explores a situation faced by a hypothetical insurance company, PiTU S.A., which is looking to adjust its car insurance premiums in response to an anticipated increase in claims.</h3>
<p>The management at PiTU S.A. has learned that a large number of drivers from Dzhydzhikistan, who are known for their reckless driving habits, are likely to get naturalized and become their potential customers. They foresee a spike in the number of claims and are now considering a revision of the current insurance premium of 500 PLN.</p>
<p>The project uses Julia programming language to simulate this scenario and answer the following critical questions:</p>
- Determining the Premium - What should the car insurance premium be to ensure that PiTU S.A. doesn't go bankrupt due to the increased number of claims?<br />
- Surplus Equilibrium - Will the final surplus be equal to the initial one? The company currently has a surplus of 10,000 PLN.<br />
- Risk of Ruin - What's the risk of the company going into ruin (i.e., the company's liabilities exceeding its assets)?<br />
- Balancing Risk and Premium - What should be the premium and surplus so that the probability of ruin is less than 0.01?<br />
<p>By simulating different scenarios, this project aims to provide an optimal solution that balances the need to maintain a healthy surplus and minimize the risk of ruin while not overburdening the potential customers with high insurance premiums.</p>
